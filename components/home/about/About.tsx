              Hello! I&apos;m Abhishek Saxena, and I&apos;m recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering..
              <br /><br />
              I specialize in both frontend and backend development, combining creativity and logic to deliver seamless user experiences and powerful functionality.

              On the backend, I specialize in building robust and secure RESTful APIs using both <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>Node.js with Express.js</strong>. This dual expertise allows me to design scalable, enterprise-grade applications in Java as well as fast, efficient server-side solutions in JavaScript, enabling flexibility across modern full-stack development.

              My tech stack includes React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL — along with strong experience in API integration, user authentication, and database design. I&apos;m also familiar with Docker, Linux environments, and tools like Roboflow for deploying AI/ML models.

              When I&apos;m not immersed in code, you&apos;ll probably find me wandering through the mountains — my favorite escape from the digital world.
              There&apos;s something magical about the fresh mountain air, the calmness of nature, and the energizing vibes that fuel my creativity. It&apos;s where I recharge, reflect, and reconnect with what matters most.

              I also love capturing moments through my lens — snapping scenic views, candid moments, and anything that tells a story. Photography in the mountains is more than a hobby; it&apos;s a way of preserving memories that inspire my work back at the desk.
